# ESP8266-DHT-Monitoring-through-ThinkSpeak
Set-up to stream live data feed to cloud using IoT for Real Time Monitoring System.

ThingSpeak™ is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize and analyze live data streams in the cloud. ThingSpeak provides instant visualizations of data posted by your devices to ThingSpeak. With the ability to execute MATLAB® code in ThingSpeak you can perform online analysis and processing of the data as it comes in. ThingSpeak is often used for prototyping and proof of concept IoT systems that require analytics.



On the left, we have the smart devices (the “things” in IoT) that live at the edge of the network. These devices collect data and include things like wearable devices, wireless temperatures sensors, heart rate monitors, and hydraulic pressure sensors, and machines on the factory floor.

In the middle, we have the cloud where data from many sources is aggregated and analyzed in real time, often by an IoT analytics platform designed for this purpose.

The right side of the diagram depicts the algorithm development associated with the IoT application. Here an engineer or data scientist tries to gain insight into the collected data by performing historical analysis on the data. In this case, the data is pulled from the IoT platform into a desktop software environment to enable the engineer or scientist to prototype algorithms that may eventually execute in the cloud or on the smart device itself.

An IoT system includes all these elements. ThingSpeak fits in the cloud part of the diagram and provides a platform to quickly collect and analyze data from internet connected sensors.
